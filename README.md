# Introduction to the SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) Roadmap üìú

Welcome to the SRE Roadmap, a structured and opinionated guide for anyone looking to dive into the world of Site Reliability Engineering. This roadmap is designed to help engineers, developers, and IT professionals navigate the fundamental concepts, essential tools, and best practices that define the role of an SRE.
Site Reliability Engineering is a discipline that combines aspects of software development and systems engineering to build and maintain scalable, reliable, and efficient systems. The primary goal of an SRE is to ensure that services are always available, performant, and capable of meeting user demands, while balancing innovation and stability.
This roadmap is divided into key areas, such as Distributed Systems, Reliability, Observability, Rollout Strategies, SLI/SLO/SLA, Containers, Linux, Networking, Security, Problem Analysis, and Soft Skills. Each section covers theoretical concepts, practical tools, and design patterns that are essential for success in the SRE role.
Additionally, the roadmap goes beyond just technical aspects. It also explores soft skills, such as effective communication, collaboration, and problem-solving, which are critical for working in multidisciplinary teams and tackling complex challenges.
This guide is not definitive but serves as a starting point for those looking to immerse themselves in the world of SRE. Along the way, you'll encounter topics ranging from the fundamentals of distributed systems to advanced practices like chaos engineering and incident management. The goal is to provide a comprehensive and practical overview, preparing you to face the real-world challenges of maintaining systems at scale.
Whether you're a curious beginner or an experienced professional looking to level up, this roadmap is designed to help you build a solid foundation and continuously evolve toward excellence in Site Reliability Engineering. Let‚Äôs get started! üöÄ

**Event Sourcing:** This is a useful pattern for maintaining state changes as a sequence of events.

**CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** This pattern can be useful in distributed systems for separating read and write operations.

# Reliability ‚òïÔ∏è

**Disaster Recovery:** Concepts like RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective).

**High Availability Patterns:** Such as active-active and active-passive setups.

**Service Level Objectives (SLOs):** More detailed strategies for defining and measuring SLOs.

**Incident Management:** More detailed practices like incident command system (ICS), runbooks, and playbooks.

# Observability ‚òïÔ∏è

**Distributed Tracing:** Tools like Jaeger, Zipkin, and OpenTelemetry.

**Log Management:** Tools and practices for centralized log management (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk).

**Metrics Collection:** Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and InfluxDB.

**Anomaly Detection:** Techniques and tools for detecting anomalies in metrics and logs.

# Rollout ‚òïÔ∏è

**A/B Testing:** Techniques for comparing different versions of a service.

**Dark Launching:** Strategies for testing new features with a subset of users.

**Feature Toggles:** More detailed practices and tools for managing feature flags.

# SLI/SLO/SLA ‚òïÔ∏è

**Error Budget Policies:** Detailed strategies for managing and spending error budgets.

**Service Level Indicators (SLIs):** More examples and detailed strategies for defining SLIs.

# Container ‚òïÔ∏è

**Container Security:** Best practices for securing containerized applications.

**Service Mesh:** More detailed exploration of tools like Istio and Linkerd.

**Container Networking:** Concepts like CNI (Container Network Interface) and network policies.

# Linux ‚òïÔ∏è

**Systemd:** Understanding and managing services with systemd.

**Kernel Tuning:** Basic kernel parameters and tuning for performance.

**Security:** Basic Linux security practices like SELinux, AppArmor, and firewalls.

# Network ‚òïÔ∏è

**Network Security:** Concepts like firewalls, VPNs, and intrusion detection systems.

**Load Balancing Algorithms:** More detailed exploration of algorithms like round-robin, least connections, and IP hash.

**Network Monitoring:** Tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, and Nagios.

# Security ‚òïÔ∏è

**Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Concepts and tools for managing identities and access.

**Security Best Practices:** Regular security audits, penetration testing, and vulnerability scanning.

**Zero Trust Architecture:** Principles and practices for implementing zero trust security.

# Analysis ‚òïÔ∏è

**Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** More detailed techniques and tools for RCA.

**Post-Incident Reviews:** Best practices for conducting and documenting post-incident reviews.

**Continuous Improvement:** Strategies for continuously improving systems and processes based on incident learnings.

# Other ‚òïÔ∏è

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Pulumi.

**CI/CD Pipelines:** Best practices and tools for continuous integration and continuous deployment.

**Cloud Providers:** Specific knowledge about major cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) and their services.

# Soft Skills ‚òïÔ∏è

**Stakeholder Management:** Techniques for managing expectations and communication with stakeholders.

**Conflict Resolution:** Strategies for resolving conflicts within teams.

**Time Management:** Techniques for managing time and priorities effectively.

**Mentorship:** Importance of mentorship and how to be an effective mentor.

# Additional Tools and Technologies ‚òïÔ∏è

**Monitoring Tools:** More tools like Datadog, New Relic, and Dynatrace.
